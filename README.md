# JavaMVVMRoom Project

Welcome to My JavaMVVMRoom Project! This project is developed using Java with the MVVM pattern, Room
database, and Glide dependency.
🚀 Features

    API Integration: Fetches data from an API and displays it in a RecyclerView.
    Image Management: Users can select an image from the gallery and update the item with this image instead of a URL link.

📦 Dependencies

    Java: The programming language used.
    Room: For database management.
    Glide: For image loading and caching.

📄 Project Flow

    App Launch: On launch, the app fetches data from the API and populates the RecyclerView with this data.
    Image Addition: When the user clicks the add icon on any item, an image is chosen from the gallery and saved in the Room database.
    Display Update: The chosen image replaces the URL link for that item in the RecyclerView.
